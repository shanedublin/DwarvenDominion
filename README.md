## Player Turn

A Basic turn consists of 2 main things.

### Gather resources

### Take a turn with each of your dwarves

    Unit Movement and Actions  
    Every turn each dwarf on your board gets to move and take 1 action.
    Once you take your action, the dwarf can no longer move.
    There are two types of dwarfs. Worker dwarfs, and warrior dwarfs. 

#### Worker Dwarfs  

    Worker dwarfs carry pick axes.
    They are used to collect resources, build, and upgrade. 
    You start with 2 workers and may upgrade your stronghold to have up to 4.

Warrior Dwarfs  

    Warrior dwarfs carry battle axes. 
    They mainly focus on combat and sabotage. 
    They can be used to destroy railroads, 
    Send dwarfs to the infirmary, and 
    Raid strongholds for gems. 

## 1. Gathering Resources

There are 3 primary resources you will be collecting to buy and upgrade your units and buildings.

- Stone

- Gold  

You may gather resources through several different ways  

- Using a unit action to mine a resource vein  
- Rolling resource dices for your mines and stronghold

### a. Miner Dwarves Actions

### Mine Action

    If your dwarf is on a resource tile you may mine it. 
    The dwarf rolls a number of dice based on their stronghold level.  
    IE: If the dwarf has a level 2 stronghold level and is on a resource tile it would roll 2 dice of that resource. (See stronghold section for more information)
    You may reroll the dice if the resource tile is connected to the dwarf's stronghold through rail track.

### Build or Upgrade Action

You may spend resources to build or upgrade.  

Mines

    Reward: Worker Dwarfs move for free on the tracks. And
            You may reroll any resource dice when the resource tile is connected to your stronghold through rail tracks. 
            Warriors can't ride the tracks (Their axes are too big)
    Stronghold level 2 bonus: Each dwarf may build 1 track without taking up an action

Rolling resource dices for your mines and stronghold
At the start of your turn roll dice for your mines and stronghold level. You get to roll dice for each mine you have and for your stronghold. The higher level mines you have, the more dice you will get to roll. For example if you had 1 level 1 stone mine, a level 1 metal and a level 2 metal mine, and a level 2 gold mine you would roll 1 stone dice, 3 metal dice and 2 gold dice plus any bonuses you get from your stronghold.
