First turn
Everyone rolls one of each dice. The person with the lowest roll goes first. Add These to your resource totals. Player turn proceeds with the next lowest player going next. Gold is worth the most, metal is worth 2nd, and stone is worth the least.
Player Turn
A Basic turn consists of 2 main things.
Gathering resources.
Moving and taking actions with your dwarfs.
Gathering Resources
There are 3 primary resources you will be collecting to buy and upgrade your units and buildings. They are Stone, Iron, and Gold.  

	You may gather resources through several different ways
Using a unit action to mine a resource vein
Rolling resource dices for your mines and stronghold
Trading with other players
Exchanging with the bank
 
Dice Explanation:
There are 3 die types, when rolling for resources roll the corresponding dice. 

The Stone die is a D-8 (an eight sided dice)
It has the following numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
The Metal die is a d-6 (a six sided dice)
It has the following numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5
The Gold die is a d4
It has the following numbers 0,1,2,3

Using a unit action to mine
Move a dwarf to a resource vein then use their action to mine the resource.
The dwarf rolls a number of dice based on their stronghold level.  IE: If the dwarf has a level 2 stronghold level and is on a resource tile it would roll 2 dice of that resource. (See stronghold section for more information)
Rolling resource dices for your mines and stronghold
At the start of your turn roll dice for your mines and stronghold level. You get to roll dice for each mine you have and for your stronghold. The higher level mines you have, the more dice you will get to roll. For example if you had 1 level 1 stone mine, a level 1 metal and a level 2 metal mine, and a level 2 gold mine you would roll 1 stone dice, 3 metal dice and 2 gold dice plus any bonuses you get from your stronghold. 
Trading with other players
At any point during your turn you may try to trade with another player. Trade however you’d like. You could also pay other players in actions like putting out a bounty on another player or having another player build a railroad track for you.  
Exchanging with the bank
At any point during your turn you may exchange with the bank. You may only trade up for resources. You may trade stone for metal or metal for gold, but you may not exchange gold for stone or metal.  
Trade rates: 
Stone for metal 5:1
Metal for gold  10:1
Gold for gems   10:1

Unit Movement and Actions
	Every turn each dwarf on your board gets to move and take 1 action. Once you take your action, the dwarf can no longer move. There are two types of dwarfs. Worker dwarfs, and warrior dwarfs. 
Worker Dwarfs
	Worker dwarfs carry pick axes. They are used to collect resources, build, and upgrade. You start with 2 workers and may upgrade your stronghold to have up to 4
Warrior Dwarfs
	Warrior dwarfs carry battle axes. They mainly focus on combat and sabotage. They can be used to destroy railroads, send dwarfs to the infirmary, and raid strongholds for gems. 

Movement
  Worker Dwarfs get 4 movement +2 for each stronghold level
  Warrior dwarfs get 3 movement +1 for each stronghold level
